<h1 align="center" id="title">Cart App</h1>

<p id="description">A cart app using React, Redux, React-Router-Dom, Context, Formik-Yup, etc.</p>

  
  
<h2>Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*  Login and signup based on name, email, password, phone number
*  Routing using RRD v6
*  Add and remove products from cart 
*  Checkout
*  Responsive style for mobile, tablet, laptop and large laptop



<p id="description">Because the back-end is local, login and signup does not work in online mode</p>
